# HoldBlack-Unity

This is an experimental project which demonstrates a novel gameplay mechanic. You use either the mouse or your finger to hold down in the black empty space of the screen. Physics objects then drop from the top of your screen and your objective is to avoid them with your pointer or mouse. If you stop holding down the entire game world and all objects start to rewind until you put your finger down.

This project contains in it examples of:
- How to implement an object pool.
- How to record the movements of 2D physics objects and play them back at variable speeds.
